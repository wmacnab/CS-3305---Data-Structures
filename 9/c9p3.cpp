/*
Write a recursive function that has two
inputs, first and second , which are both
strings (from <string> ). The function
should print all rearrangements of the letters in
first , followed by second . For example, if first
is the string "CAT" and second is the string "MAN" ,
then the function would print the strings CATMAN ,
CTAMAN , ACTMAN , ATCMAN , TACMAN , and TCAMAN . The
stopping case of the function occurs when the length
of first has zero characters. Weâ€™ll leave the recur-
sive thinking up to you, but we should mention that
two string member functions will make things go
smoother. These member functions are
3
void string::insert(
size_type position,
size_type number_of_copies,
char c
);
// Postcondition: The specified number of
// copies of c have been inserted into the
// string at the indicated position. Chars
// that used to be at or after the given
// position have been shifted right one spot.
void string::erase
(size_type position, size_type n);
// Postcondition: n characters have been
// removed from the string, beginning at the
// specified position.
